<p class="p1">Organic farmers and food producers grow and produce food without using synthetic chemicals such as <span class="spanp">pesticides and artificial fertilisers</span>. They do not use genetically modified (GM) components or expose food to irradiation.

Animal welfare and environmental sustainability are important issues for organic farmers. The term <span class="spanp">‘organic’</span> can also cover animal products. For example, eggs certified as organic are free range, rather than from caged (battery) hens.

Organic farming Animals raised using organic methods are treated humanely and with respect. For example, chickens are free range and not kept in cages, and cows are not kept in feed lots. Animals are also not fed any growth-regulating drugs, steroids, hormones or antibiotics. However, the animals may be treated with vaccines to prevent disease.</p>

<p class="p1">Organic farming is also concerned with protecting the environment and working in harmony with existing ecosystems – including conserving water, soil and energy, and using renewable resources and natural farming cycles.<br><br>


Organic foods are not necessarily completely chemical free. They may be grown on land not previously used for organic food production and, therefore, might contain chemical residues. However, the <span class="spanp">pesticide residues </span>in organic food are considerably lower than those found in conventional farming – where foods are produced with <span class="spanp">synthetic chemicals</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">Consumer demand for organic food is growing at a rate of &nbsp;<span class="spanp"> 20 to 30% &nbsp;</span>per year. It is estimated that more than 6 out of every 10 Australian households now buy <br>organic foods on occasion. <br><br>Popular products include fruit and vegetables, beef, non-alcoholic <br>drinks, nuts and ready to eat foods.<br><br><br>

<label>Reasons to Buy Organic Food</label><br><br>
Most people buy organically-grown food products because they are concerned about pesticides, additives, antibiotics or other chemical residues, and believe organic food is healthier.

Other reasons include – concerns with the impact of conventional farming on <span class="spanp">biodiversity and the environment</span>, and the ethical treatment of livestock.</p>

<p class="p1"><label>Organic food and nutrition content</label><br><br>
Several studies have compared the nutritional content of organic and conventionally grown plants, and most have shown no significant differences in key <span class="spanp">vitamin and mineral</span> content. <br><br>

Organic foods promote more humane treatment of animals, as well as providing meat that is free from <span class="spanp">hormones and antibiotics</span>.</p>

<div class="p1">Although the differences are small – research has shown<br> that some organic food has:
<ul>
	<li>lower nitrate levels</li>
	<li>higher vitamin C levels</li>
	<li>higher levels of some minerals (such as phosphorous, magnesium and iron).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p class="p1">Organic food is better for the environment Organic foods promote healthier and more sustainable use of natural resources. Modern conventional farming methods include excessive use of chemicals and planting only one crop multiple times (monocropping). This has led to a <span class="spanp">decline in soil fertility</span>, and an increase in <span class="spanp">salinity and blue-green algae </span>in waterways over many years.

Organic farmers try to minimise damage to the environment by diversifying their crops, using physical weed control, and animal and green manure.</p>

<p class="p1">
Organic food is often more expensive than conventionally produced food. This is because organic farming generally operates on a smaller scale and production is more labour intensive. Also, without <span class="spanp">herbicides, pesticides </span>and other chemicals, yields are generally smaller.<br><br>

<b>Organic food outlets
You can buy organic food from:</b><br>

<ul>
	<li>some supermarkets</li>
	<li>some green grocers</li>
	<li>health food shops</li>
	<li>some fresh food and farmer’s markets certified organic retailers.</li>
</ul>

<p class="p1"><label>Organic food certification</label><br><br>
Organic farms are only certified after they have been operating according to organic principles for <span class="spanp">3 years</span>. However, the use of the word ‘organic’ is not regulated in Australia, so it is important to make sure that products you buy come from certified growers and producers.

Before 2009, a standard (guidelines and rules) did not exist for domestic and imported organic foods. This led to a misrepresentation of the word ‘organic’ in the Australian domestic food market.</p>

<p class="p1">Two key standards now govern the production, processing and labelling of organic food in Australia.<br><br> These are:<br>

The National Standard for Organic and Biodynamic Produce (for exported foods)<br>
The Australian Standard for Organic and Biodynamic Products (for domestic and imported foods).
</p><br><br>

<p class="p1"><span class="spanp">‘Organic-certified produce’ </span>means the food was grown, harvested, stored and transported without the use of synthetic chemicals, irradiation or fumigants.<br><br>

<b>How to identify food certified as organic
Suggestions for making sure the food you are buying is organically grown include:</b><br><br>

If you are buying from an organic retailer – check for the Organic Retailers’ and Growers’ Association of Australia <span class="spanp">(ORGAA)</span> notice, which should be prominently displayed.
Choose foods with the label – ‘certified organic’ from one of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry accredited certifying organisations.
Check packaging for the grower’s name and certification number.
Do not be fooled by packaging that claims the produce is ‘natural’ or ‘chemical free’ if the proper certification labelling is not displayed.</p>
<div class="p1"><b>Organisations classified by the Australian government as organic certifiers:</b><br><br>

AUS-QUAL Limited (AUSQUAL)<br>
Australian Certified Organic (ACO)<br>

<div class="p1">Organic gardening
As well as purchasing organic food products, many people are adopting a sustainable lifestyle by growing their own produce, keeping backyard chickens or setting up a beehive to make their own honey.

If you choose to eat organic food, you may like to start an edible garden.<br><br> <b>Organic gardening can be enjoyed by everyone and its benefits include:</b><br><br>

increases physical activity levels<br>
reduces stress<br>
inexpensive and helps you save money<br>
less impact on the climate<br>
reduces food packaging and waste<br>
uses less chemicals<br>
saves water and lowers energy use and emissions<br>
food is more nutritious and reduces our consumption of processed foods.</div><br><br>
